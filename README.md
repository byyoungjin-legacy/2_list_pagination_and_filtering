# 2_list_pagination_and_filtering
2nd project on teamtreehouse TechDegree

# Things that I learned from this project.
I had some difficulties implementing searching features. 
Especially, considered a lot, manipulating HTMLCollection. 
I realized, even if I convert HTMLCollection to an array, that array is not hard to use to put in Dom structure. 
I solve the problem anyway, but not sure this is the best way.
I want to know. what else methodology I can use.
